movieListing app
============

Rotten Tomatoes -- CodePath bootcamp version

This app retrieves data from Rotten Tomatoes and presents it to the user in a table view.

When an user taps on a movie listing, the app opens up a view controller with more details on that specific movie.

Features:

    1) User can view a list of movies from Rotten Tomatoes.  
    2) Poster images must be loading asynchronously. (TO DO, currently it's very slow)
    3) User can view movie details by tapping on a cell
    4) User sees loading state while waiting for movies API.
    5) User sees error message when there's a networking error.  
    6) You may not use UIAlertView to display the error. (Needs work)
    7) User can pull to refresh the movie list.
